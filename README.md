 # Introduction to the TypeScript
# What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that add static typing and other features to enhance JavaScript developement .It was developed by Microsoft Oct 1,2012 and is now an open source project with a large community of contributer.
TypeScript is a JavaScript with an extra features that make code:

                       (a)  Easy to read   
                       (b)  Easy to write
                       (c)  Easy to maintain   


# Defination:
TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which means any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
## Syntax:
 variable_name:types = values
#  Why TypeScript?
TypeScript is more readable and maintainable than JavaScript. TypeScript supports abstraction through interfaces, while JavaScript does not. TypeScript allows developers to annotate code with decorators, while JavaScript does not.
Angular is modern framework built entirely inTypeScript ,and as a result,using TypeScript with Angular provides a seamless experience.
Vue is written in TypeScript itself and provide first class TypeScript support.A type system like TypeScript can detect many common error.
React is written in avaScript but it also useTypeScript.
There is also an option to create a TypeScript in Next.js that is very beneficial for us.

## Object-Oriented language:
                           TypeScript provides a complete feature of an object-oriented programming language such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, modules, etc. In TypeScript, we can write code for both client-side as well as server-side development.
## Generics :
           Generics is an important feature in TypeScript that enables developers to create reusable code components which work with different types instead of a single type. 
## TypeScript supports JavaScript libraries: 
                                        TypeScript supports each JavaScript elements. It allows the developers to use existing JavaScript code with the TypeScript. Here, we can use all of the JavaScript frameworks, tools, and other libraries easily.

## JavaScript is TypeScript: 
                       It means the code written in JavaScript with valid .js extension can be converted to TypeScript by changing the extension from .js to .ts and compiled with other TypeScript files.
## TypeScript is portable: 
                         TypeScript is portable because it can be executed on any browsers, devices, or any operating systems. It can be run in any environment where JavaScript runs on. It is not specific to any virtual-machine for execution.

## DOM Manipulation:
                TypeScript can be used to manipulate the DOM for adding or removing elements similar to JavaScript.
